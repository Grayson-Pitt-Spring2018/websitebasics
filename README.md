# Website Basics Spring 2018
This class has been created as an introductory course for K-12 school age participants to engage and become familiar with the construction of websites. After attending this course, students should be familiar with certain components of html that include but are not limited to links, navigation, and adding content such as pictures, paragraphs, etc.

## Session I - 18 April 2018
  Learning/Logistical Objectives:
       For the first session students will learn how to set up a Github account, fork the repository and begin "tinkering" with the code located in index.html.

  ##### Session I Recap 
 
It was a pleasure meeting you all! Just in case there was anything you missed in yesterday's session, the class got set up on Github and we went over interests. If you were unable to attend the first session and you are interested in joining please send your email address to any of us and we can add you to the Github classroom (emails are located below). Once you've gained access and clicked on the invitation, you will need to create a profile on Github - you will then receive an email from Github and click on the link to verify your account. After that, please fork (make a copy) of the repository, this is located in the upper right hand corner of the Github page. So pretty much

     Send email to request invite > create Github profile > verify account > fork repository > THAT'S IT FOR SESSION I

 Just in case that was a bit much to follow, there is a video below with some of the steps to make it a bit easier. Also, we will be able to assist during our next session.

## Session II - 25 April 2018

Exploring the template further...
    For today's session, students will set up their view of their recently forked respository. In order to do this, students will need to go into their settings, scroll down to  GitHub pages, make sure the source  is on the master branch, change the theme (this will not actually show that theme, but you will need to choose one regardless), and Github pages should generate a url code (the personal website). What this view will do is allow students to see their website updates as they make changes to the code. 
    Once students have their websites set up - due to the varying website interests - students will be encourages to explore websites that fit their interests (e.g. cupcakes, gaming, music, etc.) and we will explore how code changes (or stays the same) in order to develop the different sites for different purposes.
